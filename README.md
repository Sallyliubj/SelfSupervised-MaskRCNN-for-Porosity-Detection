# SelfSupervised-MaskRCNN-for-Porosity-Detection

This repository focuses on the self-supervised training pipeline for porosity detection using Mask R-CNN. It includes the implementation of a self-supervised learning process where the model iteratively improves by training on auto-generated masks. The framework facilitates continuous learning without requiring large labeled datasets, making it applicable for tasks like object detection and semantic segmentation.
